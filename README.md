# News-Classification-
project based on  machine learning 
What are the classification of news?
Newspapers are classified into three categories according to their size. They are broadsheets, tabloids and Berliners or Midis. Morning newspapers are generally broadsheets.
For example, I like to read the latest technology updates, so every time I visit a news website, I click on the technology section. But you may or may not like to read about technology, you may be interested in politics, business, entertainment, or maybe sports. Currently, the news articles are classified by hand by the content managers of news websites. But to save time, they can also implement a machine learning model on their websites that read the news headline or the content of the news and classifies the category of the news.
